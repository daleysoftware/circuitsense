CircuitSense Project
--------------------

Welcome to the CircuitSense project. CircuitSense is an application that
converts a picture of a circuit schematic to a netlist. CircuitSense was
originally developed as an iPhone application, and has since been migrated here
and transformed into a more general purpose tool.

More information about CircuitSense can be found here:
